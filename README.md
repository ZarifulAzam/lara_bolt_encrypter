# lara_bolt_encrypter
Implementation of PHP Bolt by using https://github.com/SiavashBamshadnia/Laravel-Source-Encrypter Plugins for encrypt source code of laravel.


This project is for Laravel 8. But you can use also use it For Laravel 6, 7, 9 (You just have to upgrade or downgrade this project by using composer update command)

Also I've added <b>encryption.bat</b> file for not run artisan command every time for encryption.


<i>Just remember that you must have to install php bolt in your server. Go to https://phpbolt.com/ if you didn't have bolt installed.</i>
